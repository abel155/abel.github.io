My name is Abel Gizachew .I was born on 1998 from Christian family from my mother Almaz Mrkuriaw and from my father Gizachew Amisal in Gojam; Amhara; Ethiopia .from my region Gojam the names are nominated based on the events so my name is descanded from the Bible as the reason Abel is the first child of Adam and Eve as i am the first child of my family .

I was completed elementary school in 2014 G.C then i joined Ankesha Senior Secondery and Preparatory School .in 2019 i joined one of famous and the oldest university from Ethiopia as well as from Africa which is called Addis Ababa University and now i am learning in EIABC campus which is one branch of Addis Ababa University.
